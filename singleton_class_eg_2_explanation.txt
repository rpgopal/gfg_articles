Explanation: In the Singleton class, when we first time call Singleton() method, it creates an object of class Singleton with name single_instance and return
it to the variable. Since single_instance is static, it is changed from null to some object. Next time if we try to call Singleton() method, since single_instance
is not null, it is returned to the variable, instead of instantiating the Singleton class again.
